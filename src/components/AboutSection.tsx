        From squeaky doors to complete kitchen renovations, I take on the home projects that have been giving you <b><em>the look</em></b> every time you walk by. Whether it’s fixing, assembling, patching, or upgrading, I bring the tools, the skill, and a sense of humor to get it done right. No duct-tape solutions here.
      </p>

        Big jobs, small jobs, or that thing your spouse <em>swore</em> they’d fix last summer, welcome to the zone where “someday” turns into <strong>today</strong>.
